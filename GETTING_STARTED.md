# Getting Started Guide

## 🚀 Three Ways to Run the Service

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# This script handles everything for you
./start-service.sh
```

### Option 2: With Kafka (Full Features)
```bash
# Start Kafka using Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Start the service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Option 3: Without Kafka (File Upload Only)
```bash
# Just start the service - Kafka features won't work but file uploads will
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🧪 Testing the Service

### Automated Testing (No Kafka Required)
```bash
# Run this after starting the service
./test-without-kafka.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Use the provided curl commands
./curl-commands.sh
```

### Interactive Testing
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- **Postman**: Import `postman-collection.json`

## 📁 What You Get

### Core Files
- **Application**: Complete Spring Boot microservice
- **Docker**: `docker-compose.yml` for Kafka setup
- **Samples**: Example CSV and JSON files in `samples/`
- **Tests**: Unit tests and automated testing scripts

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete setup and usage guide
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Technical details and architecture
- **GETTING_STARTED.md**: This quick start guide

### Testing Tools
- **postman-collection.json**: Postman API collection
- **curl-commands.sh**: Ready-to-use curl commands
- **test-without-kafka.sh**: Automated testing script

## 🎯 Key Features Working

✅ **File Upload**: CSV and JSON file processing  
✅ **Data Transformation**: Account masking, field normalization  
✅ **REST API**: Single trade processing  
✅ **In-Memory Storage**: Temporary trade storage  
✅ **Validation**: Input validation and error handling  
✅ **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration  

🔄 **Kafka Features** (when Kafka is running):  
✅ **Message Consumption**: From `instructions.inbound` topic  
✅ **Message Publishing**: To `instructions.outbound` topic  
✅ **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations  

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 8080 is available
lsof -i :8080

# Check Java version (requires Java 17+)
java -version
```

### Kafka Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if Kafka is running
docker ps | grep kafka

# Restart Kafka
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure files are in the `samples/` directory
- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 samples/*`
- Verify file format (CSV must have headers)

## 📊 Expected Output

### Successful File Upload Response
```json
{
  "message": "File processed successfully",
  "processedCount": 3,
  "tradeIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"]
}
```

### Transformed Output (Published to Kafka)
```json
{
  "platform_id": "ACCT123",
  "trade": {
    "account": "****7890",
    "security": "ABC123",
    "type": "B",
    "amount": 100000,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-04T21:15:33Z"
  }
}
```
